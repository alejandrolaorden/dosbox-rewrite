DOSBox-X-rewrite is planned to have a "stdio" mode, where
no audio or video is put on the display but instead a DOS
VM is run where the DOS application within is connected
to the host terminal via STDIO.

In this way, it becomes possible to run DOS compilers
and tools as if part of the host system while providing
a DOS environment for the legacy compiler.
