DOSBox-X-rewrite will contain general audio handling code
that can talk to a general backend. Audio will be allowed
both input and output.

Ideas:
- ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
- OSS (Open Sound System)
- Windows Wave audio (MMSYSTEM)
- Windows DirectSound
- Mac OS audio (whatever its called)
