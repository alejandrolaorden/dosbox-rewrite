"I don't think I see anything in there about wait states? On real hardware,
the video output circuitry (RAMDAC, or whatever they called its predecessors
in CGA days) VRAM access is mutually exclusive with CPU access."

"So you want to emulate at which cycles the video output fetches from VRAM, and
put a waitstate on the bus to block CPU access. This mechanism would also
allow you to emulate CGA snow accurately."

"CGA snow occurs because in 80c mode, CGA requires twice the VRAM bandwidth,
but it does not insert extra waitstates. Instead, CPU gets precendence on the
bus. This means that some reads can be corrupted, and the video output circuit
receives whatever data is on the bus."

"Yes, if the CPU wants to write to VRAM, it will have to wait until the video
card releases the wait state. I believe in 80c it still has the same wait
state pattern, so half of the VRAM reads block the CPU, the other half does
not."

"Which would explain the pattern you saw, where some columns are always
snow-free, and others may get snow, depending on the CPU access pattern."
