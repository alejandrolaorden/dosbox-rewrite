FIXME:
  Generic decoder needs to make printf argument size vary (%04x or %08x) based
     on argument, not assume 16-bit or 32-bit

  FSTENV is being listed as FSTENVd even in 16-bit, should be FSTENVw

  There are differences in output between -cpu 386 and -cpu 386g.

  Testing:

       # ./cpudec86 -i test3.bin -cpu 386 >/x1
       # ./cpudec86 -i test3.bin -cpu 386g >/x2
       # diff -u /x1 /x2
